Separation of Concerns
  Moved route handlers to controllers/blogs.js
  Moved database schema to models/blog.js
  Created a utils/logger.js for logging
  Created utils/middleware.js for error handling
Moved configuration values to utils/config.js
Environment Variables
  Used .env via dotenv in config.js, making it easy to change configurations without modifying code.
Middleware Handling
  requestLogger, unknownEndpoint, and errorHandler are in middleware.js, improving code readability.
Improved Mongoose Schema
Implemented .set('toJSON', {...}) to remove _id and __v, which makes the API responses cleaner.
