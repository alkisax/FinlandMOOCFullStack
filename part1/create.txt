# npm 6.x (outdated, but still used by some):
npm create vite@latest introdemo --template react

# npm 7+, extra double-dash is needed:
npm create vite@latest phonebook  -- --template react
cd introdemo
npm install 
The application is started as follows

npm run dev

The code of the application resides in the src folder. Let's simplify the default code such that the contents of the file main.jsx looks like this:

import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App'
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<App />)

and file App.jsx looks like this

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Hello world</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App


 adding to the file eslint.config.js the next line
       'react/prop-types': 0,
